# Cute Encryption/Decryption Program

Welcome to the Cute Encryption/Decryption Program! This project provides a simple encryption and decryption mechanism using various algorithms. 

## Features

- **Multiple Encryption Algorithms:** Includes basic encryption methods.
- **File Handling:** Reads from `Message.txt`, encrypts the content, and writes to `Encrypted.txt`. Decrypts from `Encrypted.txt` and writes to `Decrypted.txt`.
- **Simple Encryption/Decryption Logic:** Easy to understand and modify.

## How to Use

1. **Prepare Your Files:**
   - Create a file named `Message.txt` with the content you want to encrypt.

2. **Compile the Code:**
   ```bash
   gcc -o encrypt encrypt.c -lm
